## Installation

### Prerequisites

**Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:**

- **[Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21-windows)**: Version 21

  1. Check your Java version in the VM's terminal:  `java --version`
 
  2. If your version is anything other than 21, navigate to [this](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) link in the VM's Web Browser
 
  3. Download the correct package for your Linux machine. For us, it was the **x64 Debian Package**
 
  4. After downloading, the package should be in your ~/Downloads folder. Navigate to that in a terminal.
 
  5. Next, we need to de-package the .deb file. Within the ~/Downloads directory, run this command in the terminal: `sudo dpkg -i jdk-21_linux-x64_bin.deb`. At this point, Linux does a bunch of the work for us.
 
  6. Now, the Java version should have automatically switched to version 21. To double check, run the `java --version` command.
 
   - **If for any reason you do not have the correct Java version listed, we must run a couple commands to change it.**

      1. Run the `sudo update-alternatives â€“config java` command to open up a menu. Choose the correct Java version.

      2. Run the `sudo update-alternatives -config javac`  command. Choose the correct Java Compiler version.
   
- **[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)**: For project build management

  1. Check if Maven is installed on your VM by typing: `mvn --version` on your terminal.
 
  2. If not, type `sudo apt install maven`
 
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management (This program uses a VM that runs the PostgreSQL Database)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone Weston-Cox/Photon_LaserTag
   cd Photon_LaserTag

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install

3. **Compile the Application**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile

### Usage

* Before attempting to run the application, start the virtual machine.
